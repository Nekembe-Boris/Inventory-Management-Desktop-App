# Inventory-manager-2.0

This is an improved version on the Inventory Manager. This GUI inventory management system can be used by any individual to manage stock and it is 'Database-less' and was built solely with Pandas and CSV files (because it is quite easy to manipulate using python). It can also be used in filtering your data and you can also delete an article from inventory.

Currently working on a visualisation Tab which can give you some insight into your patterns
